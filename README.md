# Networking

## Introduction

Welcome to my Networking Labs repository! This repository documents my journey and progress through various networking labs using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary goal is to enhance my understanding of networking concepts, gain practical experience with Cisco devices, and prepare for Cisco certifications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- **Basic_Networking_Labs**: Contains foundational networking labs covering basic concepts and configurations.
- **Network Design Projects**: Includes projects focused on network design and implementation for different scenarios.

Each File in directories contains the following:

- **README.md**: An overview of the lab, including objectives, steps, and results.
- **Packet Tracer Files (.pkt)**: The actual lab configurations and network setups created in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation of network topologies, configurations, and verification steps.
- **Network Topology**: Network Topology Screenshots
- **Configuration Files**: Configuration Documentation 

## Objectives

Through these labs, I aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with Cisco networking equipment and configurations.
- Understand and implement various networking protocols and technologies.
- Prepare for Cisco certification exams such as CCNA and CCNP.
- Document my learning process and share it with others who might find it useful.

### Future Labs & Projects
- More labs and projects will be added as I progress through my studies, covering advanced topics such as OSPF, BGP, network security, and more.
