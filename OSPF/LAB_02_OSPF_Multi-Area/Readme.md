## Lab Objectives
## OSPF Multi Area

1. **Configure OSPF on Multiple Routers**
   - Set up OSPF on three routers, each in different network segments.
   - Assign the routers to different OSPF areas: Area 10, Area 20, and the backbone Area 0.

2. **Establish OSPF Neighbor Relationships**
   - Configure OSPF to establish neighbor relationships between routers.
   - Use verification commands to confirm that routers are recognizing each other as OSPF neighbors.

3. **Propagate and Learn Routes**
   - Ensure that all routers are propagating their respective network routes to each other.
   - Verify that each router's routing table includes routes to networks connected to other routers.

4. **Verify OSPF Database**
   - Inspect the OSPF link-state database on each router to ensure proper LSA (Link-State Advertisement) propagation.
   - Confirm that the database contains accurate and complete network information.

5. **Review OSPF Configuration**
   - Review the OSPF configuration settings, including network statements, area assignments, and router IDs.
   - Use OSPF-related commands to validate these settings.
