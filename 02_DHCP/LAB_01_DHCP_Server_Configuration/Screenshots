## Initial Router Configuration

This document provides the initial configuration steps for a Cisco router (R1) as part of my networking labs. The configuration includes setting up IP addresses and verifying the interface statuses.

### Router Configuration Commands

1. **Enter Enable Mode**:
   ```sh
   R1>en
   R1#sh ip int brief
   Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
