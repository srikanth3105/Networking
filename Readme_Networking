# Networking

## Introduction

Welcome to my Networking Labs repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey and progress as I work through various networking labs using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary goal is to enhance my understanding of networking concepts, gain practical experience with Cisco devices, and prepare for Cisco certifications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories two directorie
 - BaSic_Networking_Labs
 - Network Design Projects

- **README.md**: An overview of the lab, including objectives, steps, and results.
- **Packet Tracer Files (.pkt)**: The actual lab configurations and network setups created in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation of the network topologies, configurations, and verification steps.

## Objectives

Through these labs, I aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with Cisco networking equipment and configurations.
- Understand and implement various networking protocols and technologies.
- Prepare for Cisco certification exams such as CCNA and CCNP.
- Document my learning process and share it with others who might find it useful.

## Labs Included

### Lab 1: Basic Routing
- **Objectives**: Configure basic routing on Cisco routers and verify connectivity.
- **Topics Covered**: Static routing, routing tables, and basic network troubleshooting.
- **Status**: Completed

### Lab 2: VLAN Configuration
- **Objectives**: Set up VLANs on Cisco switches to segment network traffic.
